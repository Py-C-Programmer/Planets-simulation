1. The main reason to do this 'Planet movements simulator' was translating the physics laws into the computer language, what is really interesting and not very
easy engagement.

2. May be, it won't be very fascinating for everyone to enter many numbers, which represent x- and y-coordinates, speed of the planet, its color, mass and other
values in order to see the gravitational interaction of the planets, but for physics and astronomy fans it definitely will.

3. This program can be useful, for instance, on physics lessons, because it can make learning this not easy discipline more interesting and visible.

4. "Planet Simulator" was created for use on Android, because most users (judging from own experience) would prefer the phone version of such an application to
PC one.
